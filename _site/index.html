It’s not about what she says, it’s about how she says it. She has an innate gift of charismatic persuasion. She is the queen of benevolence. She is a talisman who teaches me the moral norms, the indispensable fallacies of life. The respect and love I have for her is invaluable. I could bet my life for her. No, she ain’t my infatuation or a high-school sweetheart. She’s Ruks, Miss Rukhsheen Vajifdar, the goddess of vivacity and the mistress of flamboyance. The person with the most benevolent heart, and indeed a beautiful mind. She’s my precious sensei.</p> <p>“ They say people come, they say people go but this particular diamond is extra special. ”</p> <p>She is gorgeous, charming, magnanimous… just so perfect. I know I had a crush on her since the first time I saw her. I felt an intuitive connection with her. I was very attentive and interested in English, the subject she taught, not only due to her but I also have a natural fascination towards the language. We developed a very good rapport ever since. . She was charismatic and completely indulged into teaching. She is passionate about teaching and she really loves it. So far the best professor I’ve ever encountered. I feel that our wavelengths tune in. She is my favourite person. I had even considered to switch to English as a career due to the esoteric aura she radiated. She turned that obnoxious and dull environment into an Elysium, full of euphoria and bliss.</p> <p>The wrath of her grandeur is calamitous <br /> Zenith of exquisite just like Aphrodite</p> <p>Diligence that of a honey badger, <br /> ceaseless endeavours longing for passion and contentment</p> <p>Possesses a charm of intelligence just like Athena <br /> An innate knack to inculcate wisdom <br /> Possesses an Intuitive persona which unravels the mystic revelations of life <br /> Benevolent heart as clear and as a crystal <br /> and as prodigious as the ocean</p> <p>Her vivacious persona is a glimpse into her benevolent and eternal soul</p> <p>Her aura, par excellence… <br /> Words are deceptive, abstract and generalised incompatible with feelings <br /> A colossal dilemma for mankind… <br /> Humans have become linguistic. <br /> An omnipresent barrier between what we feel and what we say <br /> Nevertheless I’ll endeavour to unravel her charisma:</p> <p>The mysticism is surreal <br /> Delightful yet esoteric <br /> Overawed and thrilled by the intensity of her vibes <br /> Her presence illuminates your persona <br /> Elevating you to the pinnacle of excellence <br /> Her fierce aura radiates a flamboyant vibe</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <!-- /cards --> </div> </div> <!-- /container --> </div> <!-- JS --> <script src="js/vendors/trianglify.min.js"></script> <script src="js/vendors/TweenMax.min.js"></script> <script src="js/vendors/ScrollToPlugin.min.js"></script> <script src="js/vendors/cash.min.js"></script> <script src="js/card-modern-blog.js"></script> <script src="js/modern-blog.js"></script> </body> </html>
